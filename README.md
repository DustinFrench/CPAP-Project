# CPAP-Project

The code was conducted in Visual Studio Code using Python. It involves scraping product data from several urls using BeautifulSoup, generating mock data from the products with the help of the random module and normal distributions, and then performing exploratory data analysis on the data using pandas and matplotlib.

The dataset was then imported into Tableau to create further visualizations on the sales of the CPAP products. Link to tableau public - https://public.tableau.com/views/CPAPProject/Dashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
